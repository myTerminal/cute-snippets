A few (cute) snippets implementing a few small features commonly found in software

## Background

I've made a collection of a few interesting, small, re-usable code-snippets that I've either wrote myself or have come across from somewhere over the internet while working with computer software professionally as well as a programming enthusiast.

These are no way designed to be drop-in solutions for a typical production code, but have mostly been preserved as a memory in their most original form possible, which is also evident from the fact that they contain a lot of language features and constructs that are pretty out-dated for their respective languages.
